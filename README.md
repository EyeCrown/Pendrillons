**Pendrillons** is a **micro RPG** that takes place in a play. Act out your role, choose your lines and actions, and engage in **turn-based** combat to influence the course of the show. But beware: an audience is **watching** the performance, and **reacting** to your every move!

Game length : around 1H

## Technical Aspect
The project use [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/), a tool for narrative design and provides a plugin on Unity. We extends the tag system to allows Narrative Designer to pass more data with **Tags** like moving character, passing animation, add screenshake. You can consult our Tags Documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/159-_DyjS9TTWnV00RtjgZEjndyuSG4_6SIDaAALb5EY/edit?usp=sharing) here.
